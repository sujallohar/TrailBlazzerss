An orrery is a mechanical model used to represent celestial bodies and their motions in the solar system. While traditional orreries typically depict planets and moons, modern or specialized orreries can include a broader range of celestial objects, including Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) such as Near-Earth Comets (NECs), Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs), and a subset of NEAs known as Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). Understanding the various types of celestial bodies an orrery can depict provides valuable insights into the complexity and diversity of objects in space that interact with Earth's orbit.

Planets

Planets are the most commonly represented celestial bodies in an orrery. These objects orbit the Sun and are divided into terrestrial planets (e.g., Earth, Mars) and gas giants (e.g., Jupiter, Saturn). Orreries typically simulate planetary orbits around the Sun, allowing users to observe their relative positions, speeds, and alignments over time.

Near-Earth Objects (NEOs)

Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) refer to celestial bodies such as asteroids and comets whose orbits bring them close to Earth's orbit. NEOs are classified based on their composition and proximity to Earth:

Near-Earth Asteroids (NEAs): These are asteroids whose orbits come within 1.3 astronomical units (AU) of the Earth. Most NEAs originate from the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, but gravitational influences can push them toward Earth’s vicinity.
Near-Earth Comets (NECs): These are comets that approach Earth’s orbit. Comets consist of ice, dust, and rocky material, and they are known for developing a bright coma or tail when they come close to the Sun. NECs have elliptical orbits that bring them near Earth periodically, depending on their orbital path.
Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs): A specific subset of NEAs, PHAs have orbits that come particularly close to Earth, posing a potential threat of impact. PHAs are defined by two criteria:
Their minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) with Earth is less than 0.05 AU.
Their diameter is typically larger than 140 meters, making them large enough to cause significant damage in the event of an impact.
Importance of NEOs in an Orrery

Including NEOs such as NEAs, NECs, and PHAs in an orrery enhances its ability to simulate realistic space environments, showcasing potential future interactions between Earth and these objects. By depicting these objects, users can visualize the paths of asteroids and comets relative to Earth's orbit, providing critical insights into planetary defense mechanisms and the importance of tracking these objects to mitigate collision risks.
